# Example ETL Project

ETL automation example using PHP, Laminas Framework Components and Server system resources for asynchronous data processing.

## Project Overview

This project is an example of a capability often required for enterprise solutions.  It provides Extract Transform and Load(ETL) processing for import data, and transforms that into actionable data for business intelligence, customer engagement and back-office operations. This project leverages abstraction, dependency injection, dynamic routing and database integration to deliver a simple ETL demonstration.

## MVC Architecture

The project is based on Model-View-Controller(MVC) architecture and implements [Laminas MVC](https://docs.laminas.dev/mvc/) framework and components.
MVC ensures `separation of concern` and promotes clean code resulting in stable operation and feature logevity.  MVC is also a well documented architecture that translates between technologies, platforms and languages.

## Prerequisites & Setup

The project was created for demonstration purpose and served from a localhost instance running [Apache2](https://httpd.apache.org/).  It could be refactored to deploy on containers(Docker), cloud services(AWS) or a dedicated web servers.  The following outlines some basic requirements for installing and running the project locally.
